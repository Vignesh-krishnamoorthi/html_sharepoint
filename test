Title:

 Your name and title
Purpose of the session: to introduce reusable components and their benefits

Slide 2: What are reusable components?
Definition: Pre-built, modular units of code that can be reused across multiple projects
Example: UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.), utility functions (e.g., sorting, validation)

1. Introduction to Reusable Components
Definition: Explain what reusable components are and their significance in software development. Emphasize that they are modular pieces of code that can be reused across different parts of an application, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
2. Importance of Reusability
Efficiency: Discuss how reusable components save time and effort by reducing redundancy in code.
Scalability: Explain how they allow for easier updates and feature additions without rewriting existing code.
Consistency: Highlight that using reusable components ensures a consistent user interface and experience across applications.
3. Common Use Cases
Examples: Provide examples of common reusable components, such as buttons, forms, navbars, and tables. Discuss how these components can be customized through props to meet various needs, as illustrated in React applications.
4. Best Practices for Creating Reusable Components
Avoid Side Effects: Stress the importance of keeping components free from side effects, such as direct API calls. Instead, these should be handled externally and passed as props.
Use Props Effectively: Show how props can be used to customize components, making them flexible and adaptable to different contexts.
Component Composition: Introduce the concept of composing components, where smaller components can be combined to create more complex ones, enhancing reusability and clarity.
5. Demonstration
Live Coding: Conduct a live coding session where you create a simple reusable component (e.g., a button) and demonstrate how to implement it in different scenarios. Use code snippets to illustrate the process.
6. Tools and Resources
Design Tools: Mention tools like Figma for designing components before coding, which can help visualize the end product.
Libraries: Introduce libraries and frameworks that support the creation of reusable components, such as React, and discuss how to publish and share these components within a team or community.
7. Q&A Session
Open the floor for questions to clarify any doubts and encourage discussion about participants' experiences with reusable components.
8. Conclusion
Summarize the key points discussed and encourage participants to start implementing reusable components in their projects to improve their coding practices.
